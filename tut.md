# C Programming Language Tut

## What is C?

C is a general-purpose, procedural, high-level programming language used in the development of computer software and applications, system programming, games, and more.

- C language was developed by **Dennis M. Ritchie** at the Bell Telephone Laboratories in 1972.
- It is a powerful and flexible language which was first developed for the programming of the UNIX operating System.

C is one of the most widely used programming languages.
C programming language is known for its simplicity and efficiency. It is the best choice to start with programming as it gives you a foundational understanding of programming.

## C Basics

##### C Language Introduction

C is a procedural programming language initially developed by Dennis Ritchie in the year 1972 at Bell Laboratories of AT&T Labs. It was mainly developed as a system programming language to write the UNIX operating system.

The main features of the C language include:

- General Purpose and Portable
- Low-level Memory Access
- Fast Speed
- Clean Syntax

These features make the C language suitable for system programming like an operating system or compiler development.

Why Should We Learn C?
Many later languages have borrowed syntax/features directly or indirectly from the C language. Like syntax of Java, PHP, JavaScript, and many other languages are mainly based on the C language. C++ is nearly a superset of C language (Only a few programs may compile in C, but not in C++).

So, if a person learns C programming first, it will help him to learn any modern programming language as well. As learning C help to understand a lot of the underlying architecture of the operating system. Like pointers, working with memory locations, etc.
